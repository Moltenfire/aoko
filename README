Aoko, a music server written in as close to pure java as I can get.

License: LGPL (I think? JAudiotagger is LGPL)

# How to run
	Modify the musicserver.properties.template appropriately in /src/main/resources and rename musicserver.properties
	Set up correct database config in app-database.xml (in /src/main/resources/spring)
	By default is set to run using derby, but can be run in MySQL by commenting in/out and modifying the appropriate parts of app-database and pom.xml (for the connector dependency)
	To test run, mvn clean jetty:run.
	
TODO:

 * Make sure everything works end-to-end
 * A UI that doesn't want make me want to die inside
 * Search
 * Scrobble
 * IRC notices.
 
But this is sufficient to be 'hubbable for now.
